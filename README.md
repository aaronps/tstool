# tstool - Tileset tool for netPanzer

This is a tool that I created to be able to do several things:

* Convert the netPanzer tilset format to png+json
* Add/remove tiles and groups from the tileset
* (some time later) Convert netPanzer maps to json+png format

The application usage is described on the documentation, but it was not updated
and it doesn't include the map conversion, but it should be easy to understand
how it works.
